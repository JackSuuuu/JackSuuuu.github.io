			<p>In this article, I will analyze the function of Art use Ai like stable diffusion and midjourney , along with their impact upon our society based on research articles , forums, and reactions of human artists.
</p>
<h2>AI and art</h2>
<p>   AI ( Artificial Intelligence) was supposed to be a concept far from art. It was created to free humans from repeating labor, making us available for more creative work— for example, art. From the day Ai begins to make an impact upon human society, art is believed to be the one and only field it cannot infiltrate.<br>
    Things have changed.<br>
    Although the first application of art-use AI came out all the way back in 2015(the first modern text-to-image model, alignDRAW),  the graphics generated  stayed pretty much nonsense—so nonsense that no artist saw AI as a threat —until 2021. It is by that time art-use Ai made a huge leap in the hands of OpenAI. “Quite suddenly, AI images were fairly comprehensible. And even more importantly, the AI combined ideas, like the various qualities of avocados with different types of chairs.( researchers demanded AI to generate chairs in the shape of avocados) Combining ideas together like this is one of the defining characteristics of creativity.”(Kirby Ferguson,May 8, 2023)In the span of six years, art-use AI went from the level of a child to that of an elite artist . The anxieties of the art community have been triggered : machines have breached into a realm we thought was the unquestionable domain of people.
</p>
<h2>How?</h2>
<p>   “An AI image generator, also known as a generative model, is an artificial intelligence system designed to create new images based on a set of input parameters or conditions. These systems use machine learning (ML) algorithms that can learn from large datasets of images, allowing them to generate new images that are similar in style and content to the original dataset.”(Alex McFarland, December 26, 2023)  The game-changing factor is “machine learning”, statistical algorithms capable of learning from data input to generate unseen data— in this case, to create artwork. In application, Ai needs two kinds of data input : Commands and resources. Commands are usually demands given in text, directly sent by user; resources, on the other hand, are the data AI learns from. <br>
    What are these resources? <br>
    The answer is any available artwork fed, in any possible form—anything from paintings and photographs to 3D models and game assets. Using the word “ fed” might be incorrect in this case, as AI could be granted access to the whole internet, where it can roam and suck in every art-sharing website, even every image it can lay its “hands” on, legally or not. ( this become one of the reasons artists hate AI)
</p>
<h2>Impact</h2>
<p>Art-use AI is now very, very good. Only the most elite artists are better, and even they can’t match AI in some areas, like fine details that are difficult to render by hand. Beyond the quality of their creation, AI has other advantages that make them superior to human artists: speed and cost.  It usually takes a commercial artist hours or even days to complete a piece of work, while AI can handle the same project within seconds, not to mention costing no money at all— consumers like that, they like that a lot. <br>
   To make things worse, there seems to be no reason for them to favor human artists anymore.<br>
    “62% of artists reported high levels of stress or total burnout. Artists lost an average of 36 opportunities in 2021, amounting to $25,000 of income, representing an 83% decrease in their already meager average income of $30,500.”( Julien Posture,May 3, 2022 )
    “ Dofresh, an experienced freelance concept artist and illustrator, received a call from an advertising company who needed his services. They hadn’t worked together in a while but the conversation continued. It was all going well until the company representative said they had only reached out because their "in-house AI technician was too busy". They were therefore 'forced' to "find an artist".”(Paul Hatton, 6 October 2023)

<h2>Reactions and the future
</h2>
<p>
    Consumers love art-use AI. They are cheap, fast, and always within reach: illustration has never been this easy for a normal person. Need help letting people understand your story better? No problem!  In a blink of an eye Ai will generate thousands of highly detailed pictures just based on your text, letting you pick the one you like most. Everyone can do this without human interference now.<br>
    On the other hand , human artists have a much more complex feeling: a mixture of rage and fear, and most of all, despair. Rage for being replaced by bots, fear of losing economy income, and despair for they have already lost the war against AI. <br>
   Don’t blame them , as they had struggled and fought.<br>
   On artist portfolio sites there have been large, self-organized protests where countless users posted a “NO AI” image at the same hour, making the entire site filled with their slogans.<br>
   On streets of many cities there have been protests, artists of all ages and fields walk onto the street ,crying out their demands, creating giant artwork in front of government buildings. When the police tried to contain their anger with force, the artists lit AI-generated artworks on fire and poured them onto the wall of riot shields.<br>
   “Not my work!”<br>
   Their most effective counter-offensive took place in  the invention of AI-disrupting softwares like “Nightshade” and “Glaze”. “ Platforms like Midjourney and Stability Diffusion have built their businesses by scraping the internet for the data sets then used by their generators. That material includes the work of artists and illustrators, almost none of whom have been asked for their consent, credited or compensated.” (Sebastian Smee,February 15, 2023 ) After all what happened, artists refuse to hand over their work for AI to learn for free — AI-disrupting softwares (these are actually AI too) stop AI peeking by editing the artwork in a way human eyes can’t recognize but “poisonous” for AI , messing up their style-forming system.<br>
    Yet, humans still lost the anti-AI war. Why?<br>
The answer is market demand. Art-use AI is cheaper, faster, more advanced,more commercial , and more suitable for society— normal people now have access to art .The intrusion of AI is more like an evolution, another industrial evolution, maybe. And sadly, the struggle of human artists may end up just like  that of their predecessors who smashed all weaving machines in Sicily during the first industrial revolution. Smashing machines, banning AI, it is the same mistake people have been making all the time— fighting the tide of the era. AI should be treated as a tool of enhancement , and that is the exact way it will be.
